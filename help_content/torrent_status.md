### Torrent Status Help

This page provides a near real-time view of the torrents currently being processed by your configured debrid service (e.g., Real-Debrid). It shows items that are actively downloading within the service and those that have recently completed.

**Active Downloads:**

*   This section lists torrents that are currently being downloaded or processed by the debrid service.
*   Each item displays:
    *   **Name:** The name of the torrent file or magnet link.
    *   **Progress:** Information about the current download status, such as percentage complete, speed, or state (e.g., "Downloading", "Waiting", "Seeding" - specific details depend on the debrid service).
*   If there are no torrents currently active in the debrid service, a "No active downloads" message is shown.

**Recently Completed:**

*   This section lists torrents that have recently finished downloading in the debrid service.
*   Each item displays the **Name** of the completed torrent.
*   **Item Count:** The total number of recently completed items is shown next to the section title.
*   **Show More/Less:**
    *   Initially, only the latest 10 completed items are displayed for brevity.
    *   If there are more than 10 items, a `Show More` button appears.
    *   Click `Show More` to expand the list and view all recently completed items.
    *   Click `Show Less` to collapse the list back to the initial 10 items.
*   If no torrents have completed recently, a "No completed downloads" message is shown.
