# cli_debrid

cli_debrid is a successor to, and pays homage to plex_debrid. cli_debrid is designed to automatically manage and upgrade your media collection, leveraging various sources and services to ensure you always have the best quality content available.

## Key Features

- **Automated Media Management**: Continuously scans for new content and upgrades existing media.
- **Multiple Content Sources**: Integrates with Plex (required) for collection management, Overseerr (required) for content requests, and MDBList (optional) for additional content discovery.
- **Intelligent Scraping**: Uses multiple scrapers to find the best quality content available.
- **Real-Debrid Integration**: Uses Real-Debrid for cached content.
- **Upgrading Functionality**: Automatically seeks and applies upgrades for newly added content.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for monitoring.

## Main Functions

### Run Program

The core functionality of the software. When started, it:

1. Scans your Plex library for existing content.
2. Checks Overseerr for requested content.
3. Scrapes various sources for the best quality versions of wanted content.
4. Manages downloads through Real-Debrid.
5. Seeks upgrades for your media.

### Settings

*The webUI settings menu is not currently functional. Settings must be configured through either editing the config.ini file, or through the terminal menu*

A settings menu allows you to configure:

- Required settings (Plex, Overseerr, Real-Debrid)
- Additional settings (Optional scrapers, MDBList, etc.)
- Scraping settings (Quality preferences, filters)
- Debug settings

### Manual/Testing Scraper

Allows you to manually initiate scraping for specific content, useful for testing and troubleshooting. The Testing Scraper allows you to fine tune your scraping settings and weights to ensure your preferred releases are grabbed.

### Debug Functions

Provides various debugging tools and logs to help diagnose issues and monitor the software's performance.

## Detailed Queue Operations
<details>
<summary>Queue Processing Intervals</summary>
<br>
cli_debrid processes different queues at various intervals to optimize performance and resource usage. Here are the default processing intervals for each queue:

- Wanted Queue: Every 5 seconds - Moves items to either Scraping or Unreleased queues
- Scraping Queue: Every 5 seconds - Searches for items and moves into Adding or Sleeping (if not found)
- Adding Queue: Every 5 seconds - Adds items to Real Debrid or moves into Sleeping (if failed)
- Checking Queue: Every 5 minutes (300 seconds) - Runs a Plex Recently Added scan and marks items as Collected if found. If an item isn't found for 6 hours move the item back into Wanted and mark the magnet as unwanted
- Sleeping Queue: Every 15 minutes (900 seconds) - Details below, used for items that have not yet been scraped successfully
- Upgrading Queue: Every 5 minutes (300 seconds) - Checks for items eligible for upgrades every 5 minutes

</details>
<details>
<summary>Additional Tasks and Their Intervals</summary>
<br>
Additional task information:

- Full Plex Scan: Every 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- Overseerr Wanted Content Check: Every 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- MDBList Wanted Content Check: Every 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- Debug Log: Every 1 minute (60 seconds)
- Refresh Release Dates: Every 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- Collected Wanted Content Check: Every 24 hours (86400 seconds)

</details>
<details>
<summary>Upgrading Queue Criteria</summary>
<br>
Items are added to the Upgrading Queue when:

- They are successfully added to Real-Debrid and moved to the Checking Queue.
- They were released within the past week

Items in the Upgrading Queue are processed every 60 minutes to check for potential quality upgrades for recently added content.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Sleep and Wake Mechanism</summary>
<br>
Items in the Sleeping Queue use a wake count system:

- Initial sleep duration: 30 minutes
- After each sleep cycle, the wake count for the item is incremented
- Default wake limit: 3 attempts (configurable in settings)
- If an item reaches the wake limit, it's moved to the Blacklisted state
- Items with a release date older than one week are also moved to the Blacklisted state

</details>
<details>
<summary>Blacklisting</summary>
<br>
Items are blacklisted (moved to the Blacklisted state) when:

- They exceed the wake limit in the Sleeping Queue
- Their release date is more than one week old and weren't found on first scrape

Blacklisted items are no longer processed by the queue system.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Multi-pack Processing</summary>
<br>
When a multi-pack result (e.g., a full season) is found:

- The original item is moved to the Checking Queue
- All matching episodes in the Wanted, Scraping, and Sleeping queues are also moved to the Checking Queue
- All moved items are added to the Upgrading Queue for potential future upgrades

</details>
<details>
<summary>Real-Debrid Integration</summary>
<br>
Items in the Adding Queue are checked for cache status on Real-Debrid
If an item is cached, it's added to Real-Debrid and moved to the Checking Queue
If Real-Debrid is unavailable, the item is moved to the Sleeping Queue to retry later

</details>
<details>
<summary>Webhook Support</summary>
<br>
cli_debrid supports webhooks from Overseerr:

- Receives notifications for new content requests
- Processes the webhook data and adds new items to the Wanted Queue

</details>

## Philosophy

### Database and "I Know What I Got"

cli_debrid maintains a local database of your media collection, keeping track of what you have and what quality it's in. This "I Know What I Got" approach allows cli_debrid to maintain a list of what you have, and what you want.

### Upgrading Functionality

cli_debrid will automatically search for and apply upgrades to newly added content, ensuring you always have the best quality available. Upgrading is applied to content with a release date of less than a week ago (or in other words, cli_debrid does not try to upgrade old content.

## Required Components

- **Plex**: Used as the primary source of information about your current media collection.
- **Overseerr**: Used to manage and track content requests, and to provide full metadata for content.

## Optional Content Sources/Other Settings

- **MDBList**: Can be used as an additional source for content discovery. Add URLs separated by commas.
- **TMDB API**: Can be used for detailed episode content like runtimes for enhanced bitrate estimation.
- **Collected**: Can be used as an additional source. Essentially this is a way to take your current library and flag all items for metadata processing. If you have a season of a show, this will then mark any other seasons/episodes as wanted.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- A Plex server
- An Overseerr instance
- A Real-Debrid account

### Setup Instructions

1. Create a directory for cli_debrid:
   ```
   mkdir -p ${HOME}/cli_debrid
   ```

2. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file from the repository:
   ```
   cd ${HOME}/cli_debrid
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godver3/cli_debrid/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Start the container:
   ```
   cd ${HOME}/cli_debrid
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Connect to the container to run the program, adjust settings, test scraping:

   ```
   docker attach cli_debrid
   ```

Ctrl-P then Ctrl-Q to detach from the container rather than exiting the script.


5. Access the web interface (note - only accessible when the program has been started):
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:5000`

6. Configure additional settings:
   Edit the `config.ini` file or edit settings in termainl to configure additional settings such as scrapers, MDBList integration, and scraping preferences.

### Post-Setup

- Monitor the logs at `${HOME}/cli_debrid/user/logs` - shout out to "lnav" as a great log viewer
- Check the content of your queues in the webUI
- Use the web interface to monitor queue status and statistics. The statistics screen is essentially nonsense right now, but it's fun to look at
- Adjust settings as needed to scrape for exactly the results you want

### Updating

To update to the latest version of cli_debrid:

```
cd ${HOME}/cli_debrid
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

This will pull the latest image and restart the container with the updated version.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to:

- Various other projects that have come before this one, and likely do things better in many ways
- The original creator of plex_debrid
- Helpful communities of content creators

## Caveat

I'll include a caveat that this project was built almost entirely using AI (though I have a bit of experience working with code in the past). I would say I learned a fair bit through the process and overall enjoyed getting to this point. That said, I'll do what I can to fix things, but cli_debrid is built almost entirely on spaghetti and probably has lots of brow-raising content. Apologies in advance real devs who decide to look under the hood.

## To Do

- Allow settings to be edited through the webUI
- Allow program control through the webUI
- Review for async program options (currently only running scraping itself as async, RD operations could likely run async as well)
- More...?
