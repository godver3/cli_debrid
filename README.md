## Overall Program

### Run Program

The core functionality of the software. When started, it:

1. Scans your Plex library for existing content.
2. Checks content sources for any wanted content that isn't already collected.
3. Scrapes various sources for the best quality versions of wanted content.
4. Manages downloads through your Debrid provider.
5. Seeks upgrades for your media if available.

### dev vs main

dev is the latest version of cli_debrid, and is built for arm64 and amd64. It is not recommended for production use.

main is the stable version of cli_debrid, and is built for amd64. It is recommended for production use.

### Library Management

Supports either a Plex or Symlinked library:

- Plex: Uses Plex's API to get your library and track what you have.
- Symlinked: Uses a local folder structure to track your library.

### Settings

A settings menu allows you to configure all program settings:

- Required settings (Plex, Debrid Provider, Trakt)
- Scrapers (Zilean, Jackett, Torrentio, Nyaa)
- Scraping settings (Quality preferences, filters)
- Content sources (MDBList, Collected content, Trakt watchlists/lists, Overseerr)
- Additional settings (UI settings, TMDB key, Metadata age threshold, deletions syncing, queue management)
- Advanced settings
- Notifications (Discord, Email, Telegram, NTFY)
- Reverse Parser (used to assign versions to existing content through regex terms)

### Manual/Testing Scraper

Allows you to manually initiate scraping for specific content. The Testing Scraper allows you to fine tune your scraping settings and weights to ensure your preferred releases are grabbed.

### Debug Functions

Provides various debugging tools for advanced users.

## Detailed Queue Operations
<details>
<summary>Queue Processing Intervals</summary>
<br>
cli_debrid processes different queues at various intervals to optimize performance and resource usage. Here are the default processing intervals for each queue:

- Wanted Queue: Every 5 seconds - Moves items to either Scraping or Unreleased queues
- Scraping Queue: Every 5 seconds - Searches for items and moves into Adding or Sleeping (if not found)
- Adding Queue: Every 5 seconds - Adds items to Real Debrid or moves into Sleeping (if failed)
- Checking Queue: Every 5 minutes (300 seconds) - Runs a Plex Recently Added scan and marks items as Collected if found. If an item isn't found for 6 hours move the item back into Wanted and mark the magnet as unwanted
- Sleeping Queue: Every 15 minutes (900 seconds) - Details below, used for items that have not yet been scraped successfully
- Upgrading Queue: Every 5 minutes (300 seconds) - Checks for items eligible for upgrades every 5 minutes

</details>
<details>
<summary>Additional Tasks and Their Intervals</summary>
<br>
Additional task information:

- Full Plex Scan: Every 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- Overseerr Wanted Content Check: Every 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- MDBList Wanted Content Check: Every 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- Debug Log: Every 1 minute (60 seconds)
- Refresh Release Dates: Every 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- Collected Wanted Content Check: Every 24 hours (86400 seconds)

</details>
<details>
<summary>Upgrading Queue Criteria</summary>
<br>
Items are added to the Upgrading Queue when:

- They are successfully added to Real-Debrid and moved to the Checking Queue.
- They were released within the past week

Items in the Upgrading Queue are processed every 60 minutes to check for potential quality upgrades for recently added content.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Sleep and Wake Mechanism</summary>
<br>
Items in the Sleeping Queue use a wake count system:

- Initial sleep duration: 30 minutes
- After each sleep cycle, the wake count for the item is incremented
- Default wake limit: 3 attempts (configurable in settings)
- If an item reaches the wake limit, it's moved to the Blacklisted state
- Items with a release date older than one week are also moved to the Blacklisted state

</details>
<details>
<summary>Blacklisting</summary>
<br>
Items are blacklisted (moved to the Blacklisted state) when:

- They exceed the wake limit in the Sleeping Queue
- Their release date is more than one week old and weren't found on first scrape

Blacklisted items are no longer processed by the queue system. Blacklisted items are woken per your Blacklist Duration.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Multi-pack Processing</summary>
<br>
When a multi-pack result (e.g., a full season) is found:

- The original item is moved to the Checking Queue
- All matching episodes in the Wanted, Scraping, and Sleeping queues are also moved to the Checking Queue
- All moved items are added to the Upgrading Queue for potential future upgrades

</details>
<details>
<summary>Webhook Support</summary>
<br>
cli_debrid supports webhooks from Overseerr:

- Receives notifications for new content requests
- Processes the webhook data and adds new items to the Wanted Queue
- To use, enable the Webhook agent in Overseerr, set the URL to https://localhost:5000/webhook (or wherever Overseerr can see your cli_debrid instance at) and enable Notifications for "Request Pending Approval" and "Request Automatically Approved"

cli_debrid also supports webhooks from Zurg if using a Symlinked library (for a Plex library use the typical Zurg Plex update script):

- Receives notifications for quick matching and symlinking from Zurg
- To use, in the Zurg config.yml add:
```on_library_update: sh ./update.sh "$@"```
- Then create an update.sh file in the same location as the Zurg config.yml
```#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
webhook_url="https://cli-debrid.godver3.xyz/webhook/rclone"  # Replace with your actual webhook URL

# First notify our webhook for each file
for arg in "$@"
do
    arg_clean=$(echo "$arg" | sed 's/\\//g')
    echo "Notifying webhook for: $arg_clean"
    encoded_webhook_arg=$(echo -n "$arg_clean" | python3 -c "import sys, urllib.parse as ul; print(ul.quote(sys.stdin.read()))")
    curl -s -X GET "$webhook_url?file=$encoded_webhook_arg"
done

echo "Updates completed!"
```
- This will notify cli_debrid for each file that is updated, and cli_debrid will then process the file and process its symlink.

## Philosophy

### Database and "I Know What I Got"

cli_debrid maintains a local database of your media collection, keeping track of what you have and what quality it's in. This "I Know What I Got" approach allows cli_debrid to maintain a list of what you have, and what you want. Other philosophies include minimized API calls, high specificity in scraping, and an easy to use interface, with a highly complex backend.

## Required Components

- **Plex**: Used as the primary source of information about your current media collection.
- **Trakt Account**: Used by our Metadata Battery to retrieve all needed Metadata.
- **Debrid Provider**: A Real-Debrid API key.
- **Method to Mount Media from Debrid Provider**: While we don't require Zurg, we highly recommend this as a very effective way to locally mount your Debrid Provider's content locally for Plex to see.

## Optional Content Sources/Other Settings

- **TMDB API Key**: Used to retrieve Home Screen posters.
- **Collected**: Can be used as an additional source. Essentially this is a way to take your current library and flag all items for metadata processing. If you have a season of a show, this will then mark any other seasons/episodes as wanted.
- **Debug Settings**: Many, many debug settings beneath the hood, most of which should be left alone.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to:

- Various other projects that have come before this one, and likely do things better in many ways
- Specific thanks to the NyaaPy and PTT/Parsett libraries (https://github.com/JuanjoSalvador/NyaaPy and https://github.com/dreulavelle/PTT)
- The original creator of plex_debrid
- Helpful communities of content creators

## Caveat

I'll include a caveat that this project was built almost entirely using AI (though I have a bit of experience working with code in the past). I would say I learned a fair bit through the process and overall enjoyed getting to this point. That said, I'll do what I can to fix things, but cli_debrid is built almost entirely on spaghetti and probably has lots of brow-raising content. Apologies in advance real devs who decide to look under the hood.
